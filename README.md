42 so_long project started in 12/03/2022 and finished in 27/03/2022.

The V2 version is complete and playable with every map and amount of enemies ! 
You can create a collection of maps and put it in the 'map' directory ! (map must have the same name followed by a number that indicates the order)
You can also start a single map like this ("./so_long ./map/map3.ber").
